Our team is recruiting Georgia Tech students interested in **audio hardware design** and/or **mobile app development**. The only compensation we can offer at this time is the use of BMED 4603 as a fun 3-credit free elective that will give you valuable experience in medical device design. If interested please email us a resume and a description of your interest at [libimedical@gmail.com](mailto:libimedical@gmail.com).
